# Hopfield-Reconstruction
Creating a Hopfield artificial neural network that uses "associative" memory systems, to learn and reconstruct numbers.

Given a file with number examples, the network will learn the numbers set.
Each number example will be represented by a binary matrix.
Then, given any number with slight changes in the number representation, we will try and reconstruct the original number.

For example:
Given the right representation of the number 3, we will try and change the given example into the left picture, the original number.

We will also explore the success rate of this network whilst changing different conditions.

An example of a reconstructed number:
